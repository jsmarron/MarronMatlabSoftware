To all who get access to this folder:

1) The data found in this folder are not to be shared without the permission of 
   Alf Harbitz at the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research.

	alf.harbitz@imr.no

2) Do not MOVE the files out of the folder, but copy them out of the folder if you need them. 
   The GUI can be run without any problem straight from the DropBox folder.

3) Do NOT rename the .mat file - the newest file that you want to run must be called "GUI_Otoliths.m". 
   This is important since the file calls itself, and if you have renamed it, you might be calling a older 
   version of the GUI when doing the self-calling.

4) The newest version of the GUI should be modified at 18th March at time 23:35. 
   This version should work on both Windows and OSX.

5) I have included a Matlab 'app'. To install a Matlab 'App':
   In the main window, go to the upper left and find the 'APPS' tab. 
   In the upper left, then select "Install App", and find the app file in the DropBox. 
   Install it, and on the top row of possible Apps, click the arrow down symbol on the right. 
   Under 'My apps' you should find the App you just installed.
