Some comments:

1.  Please delete all "path" commands.  I prefer to require these be set before 
running.

2.  When I ran the first test (itest == 1), it gave dots in the PCA plots, but 
that is not listed as the default marker.  The default sounds better, so let's 
make that happen.

3.  itest = 101 gives an error

4.  itest = 103 & 106   generates an unexpected warning about legends

5.
