To do:  

In SigClust:  Update to Generation 3, which takes max of hard and soft 
thresholded p-values

In MargDistPlot:
Line 488 Change 
    viplot = (1:np)' ;
to:
    viplot = (1:np-1)' ;
(for some cases, e.g. small d?)


Write Transformation Explorer (either Box-Cox, or Shifted log), which allows looking through candidates
Univariate:  works like MargDistPlot, only on transformed variables
Multivariate:  Apply common transform, and have different page for different transforms, and look at MargDistPlot type display, but keep variables same accross trans's.

Future Projects:

Redo vec2matSM.m, using repmat

Explore Di Cook's graphics ideas (summarized in Hadley 
    Wickham's thesis):    http://had.co.nz/thesis
- Light gray background (for color plots)
- axes in white
- allow square aspect ratios
All of these need some careful experimentation, and
    investigation, including printing checks.
- allow filesaves as .png files

Solve problem of increasing level of {{{  }}}s
needed when passing cell strings, such as
titlecellstr, using paramstruct.
Problem seems related to:
"titlecellstr{1}" when passing structures

-  Explore use of gplotmatrix.m in scatplotSM & curvdatSM
        (big plus is can use cursor to identify individuals)

-  Modify pcaSM (or write new routine???)to:
  - Use SVD as its engine
  - do proper analysis of dual problem
  - allow mean recentering to be any of none, row mean, or
       col mean
  - allow full matrix data view as mesh plot (probably will need 
       suitable decimation) and (red-blue) image plot

-  Update SizerSM, and that part of curvdatSM, to allow 
     current offerings of kdeSM:
       -  current color schemes
       -  markers
       -  dolhtseed everywhere to be:
          empty - use input data ordering
          0     - use current seed random ordering
          seed  - use that for random ordering
