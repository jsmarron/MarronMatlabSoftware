Derek Tucker Software Key:

Only need to call time_warping.m

Inputs: 
f - matrix of curves as columns (d x n)
t - vector of common time points (d x 1)?
lambda, tuning parameter (default = 0)
option (see Derek's function)

Outputs:

fn - aligned functions (d x n), uses t as horizontal coords
qn - aligned vertical SRVF functions (d x n), uses t as horizontal coords
q0 - unaligned vertical SRVF functions (d x n), uses t as horizontal coords
fmean - Karcher mean (d x 1), uses t as horizontal coords
mqn - ???
gam - warping functions (d x n), nice plot is as a function of [1:d]'/(d+1)?
                or is it a function of (t - min(t)) / (max(t) - mint(t)?
                     (doesn't matter when t is equally spaced)
psi - horizontal SRVF functions (d x n), or is it ((d - 1) x n)?
            Should we list a way of plotting these?
stats - ???
